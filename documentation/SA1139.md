:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A cast is perform instead of using literal of a number. 

## Rule description

A cast is perform instead of using literal of a number. Use "L" suffix to create long literals, "UL" for unsigned long, and "m" for decimals.

For example, the following code would produce a violation of this rule:

```csharp
var x = (long)1;
```

The following code would not produce any violations:

```csharp
var x = 1L;
```
