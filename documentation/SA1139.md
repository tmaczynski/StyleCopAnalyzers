:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A cast is performed instead of using literal of a number. 

## Rule description

A cast is performed instead of using literal of a number. Use "U" suffix to create 32-bit unsigned integer literal, use "L" for 64-bit integer literal and "UL" for 64-bit unsigned integer literal.

For example, the following code would produce a violation of this rule:

```csharp
var x = (long)1;
```

The following code would not produce any violations:

```csharp
var x = 1L;
```
